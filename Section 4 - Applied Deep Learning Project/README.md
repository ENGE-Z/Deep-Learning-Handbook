# Section 4 Summary 
## Building an Image classifier
--start with the basic clothing image classifier example in module 1 

-- module two is a similar classifier but applied to a higher resolution dataset ((student can choose the dataset they want to work with from a list ?)
    -- results for this simple classifier will be analyzed (student to think about why the model performs bad on this data)
    
---module 3 is a more advanced classifier using covnet and shows how changing the structure of the NN imporves the results further (https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/master/ml/pc/exercises/image_classification_part1.ipynb)

-- moodule 4 is how to deal with overfitting in a model and how accuracy of a model can be imporved
