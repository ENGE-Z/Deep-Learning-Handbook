# Module 1.2 
The Python programming comes packaged with a vast collection of libraries full of various functions used to make achieving a certain coding goal much easier. This module will take you through some of the most fundamental libraries used in python as well as the proper syntax when writing python code. 

## Datatypes
popular datatypes withing python are Datatypes: Array, String, List, Tuple

## Functions
functions are essential in ptyhon and used to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. That means that a function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task. (Datacamp 2021)

## Loops and conditional statements
Conditionals and loops control the flow of a program. They are essential to performing virtually any significant computational task. Python, like most computer languages, provides a variety of ways of implementing loops and conditionals. (Python for Science, 2014)

## Libraries and modules
The Python computer language consists of a “core” language plus a vast collection of supplementary software that is contained in modules. Many of these modules come with the standard Python distribution and provide added functionality for performing computer system tasks. (Python for science, 2014)
