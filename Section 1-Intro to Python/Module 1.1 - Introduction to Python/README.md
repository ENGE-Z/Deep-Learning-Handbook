## Python overview
Python is very popular, high-level, dynamic programming language.  The design and structure of python emphasizes code readability and allows concepts to be expressed in fewer lines of code. Python supports many programming/procedural styles including object-oriented, imperative, and functional. 

An extensive overview of the concepts and features of the Python Language ios available at the official documentation website: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

## Using Python 
To get started with hands on experience on implementing python projects you must have access to a python interpreter. 
There are several ways to write and run python code with the interpreter. This can be from:

	• installing the interpreter and invoking commands via the command line
  
	• Installing a IDE application with progamming language plugins
  
	• Accessing an online Python compilier provided by websites such as tutorials point (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php) or repl it (repl.it - Python)
  
	• Jupyter notebooks containing computer code and text elements to easily convey objectives
