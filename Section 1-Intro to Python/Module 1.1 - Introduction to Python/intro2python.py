# below is the introduction code for Deep Learning Handbook Module 1.1 
#
# In the python language the '#' chracter has a special function of assigning a line of code as being a comment used to explain the code written and is not processed when the code is ran 
# this expression will not be executed: 7 + 15 
# the below expression will be executed:
print(7+15)
# using the 'print' function allows the result of the expressioin to be viewed in the console. without this function the expression will be computed internally but not displayed.
7+15

# In python there are several other special chracters that serve important roles in writing code. these special symbols are defined as Operators.

#Some important Types of Operators: Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Bitwise, Assignment
# further information on the operators and their meanings can be found at https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/operators 

# uncomment the two lines of code below then assign values to the two variables x and y:
# x = 
# y = 

# below are some example cases of implementing the special characters on the two variables you defined above to x and y
#uncomment the lines of code below to see the results


#print('x + y =',x+y)

#print('x - y =',x-y)

#print('x * y =',x*y)

#print('x / y =',x/y)

#print('x // y =',x//y)

#print('x ** y =',x**y)

#print('x > y is',x>y)

#print('x < y is',x<y)

#print('x == y is',x==y)

#print('x != y is',x!=y)

#print('x >= y is',x>=y)

#print('x <= y is',x<=y)
